<H1>East-West Bridge Problem</H1>

<h2>
Problem
</h2>
   There is a bridge which is aligned along the east-west direction.   This
bridge is too narrow to allow cars to go in both directions.  Hence,
cars must alternate going across the bridge.   The bridge is also
not strong enough to hold more than three cars at a time.   Find 
a solution to this problem which does not cause starvation.  That
is, cars that want to get across should eventually get across.
However, we want to maximize use of the bridge.  Cars
should travel across to the maximum capacity of the bridge (that
is, three cars should go at one time).   If a car leaves the bridge
going east and there are no westbound cars, then the next eastbound
car should be allowed to cross.  We don't want a solution which
moves cars across the bridge three at a time, i.e., eastbound
cars that are waiting should not wait until all three cars that
are eastboung and crossing the bridge have crossed before
being permitted to cross.

<h2>
Solution
</h2>
  I believe this problem can be recast as a multiple readers
writers problem.   Here's how it works.  Intuitively, if you
are a reader coming to the room, and you see writers in the 
room, you sit on the bench (if you are an eastbound car, and
westbound cars are going across, you wait).   If you are a reader, 
and there are fewer than three readers, and there are no writers 
waiting, you enter the room.   If you are a reader, and there 
are already three readers, then you wait.   If you are reader, 
and are exiting the room, then if there are no writers, but there 
are readers waiting, you let a single reader in.   If there are 
writers waiting, but you are not the last reader to leave, you 
just leave.  If you are the last reader to leave, there should be 
no waiting readers unless there are waiting writers.  In either 
case, you let up to three writers into the room.
<P>
  The main difference between the multiple readers-multiple writers
problem (the exam problem) is that at most three readers or writers
can be in the room at the same time.   We still have the last reader
potentially letting up to three writers in and vice versa.
<P>
  Below is code for the reader processes.   The writer process
is analogous.   Just replace "r" for "w" and vice-versa.  As
a reminder, <tt>r_active</tt> is the number of active readers
(readers in critical section, <tt>r_waiting</tt> is the
number of readers waiting to go into the critical section.
<tt>r_sem</tt> is the semaphore that waiting readers sleep
on.   The writers have analogous variables. <tt>lock</tt> is 
a mutex semaphore used by both readers and writers.  

<PRE>
 1   P( lock ); // lock is a mutex and is initializes to 1.
 2   if (( nw_active + nw_waiting == 0 ) && ( nr_active < 3 ))
 3     {
 4        nr_active++; // Notify we are active
 5        V( r_sem );  // Allow ourself to get through
 6     }
 7   else
 8     nr_waiting++;  // We are waiting
 9   V( lock );
10   P( r_sem );  // Readers will wait here, if they must wait.

14   P( lock );
15   nr_active--;
16   if (( nr_active == 0 ) && ( nw_waiting > 0 )) 
17     { // If we are the last reader
18        count = 0;  // Makes sure we only at most 3 writers in
19        while (( nw_waiting > 0 ) && ( count < 3 ))  
20        {
21           V( w_sem );  // wake a writer;
22           w_active++;  // one more active writer
23           w_waiting--; // one less waiting writer.
24           count++;     
25        }
26      }
27    else if (( nw_waiting == 0 ) && ( nr_waiting > 0 ))
28      {  // allow another waiting reader to go in, if no waiting writers
29        V( r_sem );
30        w_active++;  // one more active reader
31        w_waiting--; // one less waiting reader.          
32      }
33    V( lock );

     Some invariants that hold:
<UL>
  <LI>   Safety conditions:  Readers and writers can not be active at
               the same time.
  <UL>
  <LI> <tt>     nr_active <= 3  </tt>
  <LI> <tt>     nw_active <= 3  </tt>
  <LI> <tt>     nr_active > 0 -> nw_active == 0  </tt>
  <LI> <tt>     nw_active > 0 -> nr_active == 0  </tt>
  </UL>

  <LI>    Other conditions.
  <UL>
  <LI> <tt>     nr_active > 0 & nr_waiting > 0 -> nw_waiting > 0 </tt>
  <LI> <tt>     nw_active > 0 & nw_waiting > 0 -> nr_waiting > 0 </tt>
  </UL>

</UL>

   In case you are interested, this problem was on a grad level
Ph.D. exam.   There is a certain lack of realism here.   When the
three cars are going across, this implementation doesn't really
force the first process that enters the bridge to complete first.
I.e., if we have three cars, A, B, and C, and they enter in that
order, they will also leave in that order.   The above basically
lets three in, and they can leave in any order.
